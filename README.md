Known Complications with Mac  
Something unique must be happening with Mac and Chrome as a CORS error appears there but not when the user/client is using windows with google chrome

To circumvent this for now:
1. In Keycloak (localhost: 8080) go to the demo realm, click on client, then front-end, then scroll down to "valid URIs" and replace what was auto filled with "*"
2. Open up google chrome without web security using the command $ open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security â€”user-data-dir

In case you want to do a hard reset, you want to close and purge all Docker containers by following the next commands:
1. docker ps (To inspect current running containers)
2. docker stop <container id>
3. docker system prune -f -a
4. docker volume prune
